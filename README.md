# React Native FlatList: Inconsistent Data Structure in `renderItem`

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native: inconsistent data structures provided to the `renderItem` function. This can lead to unexpected errors and crashes.

## Problem

The `FlatList` component expects a consistent data structure for each item in the `data` prop. If the structure is inconsistent or missing required fields, the `renderItem` function will fail, leading to an error.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that every item in the data array has the same structure and contains all the fields required by the `renderItem` function.  Properly utilizing unique keys is also important when dealing with dynamically updating data.
