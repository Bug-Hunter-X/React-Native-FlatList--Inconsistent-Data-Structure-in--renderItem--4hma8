This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect or incomplete data structure to the `data` prop.  The `renderItem` function expects a specific structure for each item in the data array. If the structure is inconsistent or missing required fields, you'll encounter this error.

Example of incorrect data:
```javascript
const data = [
  {id: 1, title: 'Item 1'},
  {id: 2, title: 'Item 2'},
  {id: 3}
];
```

Here, the third item is missing the `title` field, leading to the error.

Another common cause is using a different key for rendering items each time the list updates. This can happen when the data array is being modified and the keys are not consistently unique and stable.
